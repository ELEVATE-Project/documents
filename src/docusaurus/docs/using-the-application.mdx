# About the Mentor Application

The reference solution (<PartialExample mentored />) uses all the microservices available in this building block, like <PartialExample mentored />, Notifications, Scheduler, and User Management. It scaffolds the following processes:

1. Build an open network of mentors and enable them to host mentoring interactions.
2. Make them searchable (discoverable) by registered mentees or mentors.
3. Enable users to discover mentors and establish contact with them.
4. Enable communication to plan the implementation of the mentoring sessions.
5. Capture feedback to evaluate the quality of interaction. 

## Getting Started with Mentor

The <PartialExample mentored /> building block enables virtual mentorship capability along with the microservices. One of the most important things to recognise about **mentoring as an approach to learning** is that it is incredibly diverse and can have a formal or informal setup. The <PartialExample mentored /> capability can be deployed as a stand-alone solution or integrated with a learning and development program. Its salient features are as follows:

* Intuitive Android and web interface for all users 
* Role-based workflow for mentor and mentee
* Mentoring session broadcast and session discovery 
* Group sessions (one to many)
* Virtual meeting platforms such as BigBlueButton (default) and others
* Communication using notifications and emails
* Reports for mentors and mentees
