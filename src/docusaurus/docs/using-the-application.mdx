# About the Mentor Application

The reference solution (<PartialExample mentored />) uses all the microservices available in this building block, like <PartialExample mentored />, Notifications, Scheduler, and User Management. It scaffolds the following processes:

1. Build an open network of mentors, who can host mentoring interactions.
2. Make them searchable (discoverable) by registered mentees or mentors.
3. Discover mentors and establish contact with them.
4. Communicate to plan the implementation of the mentoring sessions.
5. Capture feedback to evaluate the quality of interaction. 

The <PartialExample mentored /> building block and the associated microservices provide virtual mentorship capabilities. One of the most important things to recognise about **mentoring as an approach to learning** is that it is incredibly diverse and can have a formal or informal setup. 

The <PartialExample mentored /> capability can be deployed as a standalone solution or integrated with a learning and development program. Its salient features are as follows:

* Intuitive web interface for all users 
* Role-based workflow for organization administrator, mentor, and mentee
* Mentoring session broadcast and session discovery 
* Group sessions (one to many)
* Virtual meeting platforms such as BigBlueButton (default) and others
* Communication using notifications and emails
* Reports for mentors, mentees, and organization administrators
