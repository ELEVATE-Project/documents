# Set Rules for Mentor and Session Discovery

Organization administrators can set rules or conditions based on which users can discover mentors or sessions on the application according to the rules set.

Examples:

* By setting rules that match users with mentors based on their preferred languages, users can view only the mentor profiles that match their languages of preference.

* By setting rules that match users with sessions based on their preferred languages, organizations can achieve any one of the following:

    * Users can view sessions where the language of instruction matches their languages of preference.

    * Mentees can view sessions hosted by a mentor who match their languages of preference.
