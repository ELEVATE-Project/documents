# Set Policies for an Organization

Organization administrators can set policies for the following aspects:

  * Visibility policies: Manage how sessions, mentors, or mentees are accessed by other organizations.

  * External visibility policies: Manage how a mentee can access sessions, mentors, or mentees of other organizations.

To learn more about the types of policies that can be configured, see [Policy Architecture](policyarchitecture#policy-architecture).
