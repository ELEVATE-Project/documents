# Set Default Rules for an Organization

Organization administrators can set default rules or conditions based on which users can discover mentors or sessions on the application. Therefore, users within the organization can only discover mentors or sessions that satisfy the default rules.

Examples:

* By setting default rules that match users with mentors based on their preferred languages, users can view only the mentor profiles that match their languages of preference.

* By setting default rules that match users with sessions based on their preferred languages, organizations can achieve any one of the following:

    * Users can view sessions where the language of instruction matches their languages of preference.

    * Mentees can view sessions hosted by a mentor who match their languages of preference.
