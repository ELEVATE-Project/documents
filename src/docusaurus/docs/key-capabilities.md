# Key Capabilities of Mentor

Using the <PartialExample mentored /> building block, domain experts or mentors become easily accessible to mentees through online interactions. The capability leverages video conferencing tools for mentees to connect and join mentoring sessions.

>

<PartialExample mentored /> currently supports group and one-on-one mentoring interactions. In group mentoring, a group of mentees get associated to a mentor in a session. The mentor creates sessions and publish them on the platform. The session follows a format similar to a webinar. However, it encourages a long-term relationship between mentors and mentees. 

>

Through group mentoring, mentees can access upskilling and capacity-building opportunities. It also opens doors for interdisciplinary skill development. 

>

On the other hand, a one-on-one mentoring session involves assigning a mentee to a mentor. Through one-on-one mentoring, mentees can address their goals and concerns about their professional development and receive personalized guidance from the mentor.

## Capabilities of Mentor

One of the most important things to recognize about **mentoring as an approach to learning** is that it is incredibly diverse and can have a formal or informal setup.
