# Multi-Tenant Architecture

The <PartialExample mentored /> platform has a multi-tenant architecture, and adopters can:

1. Set up the application using the microservices.

2. Create multiple organizations and assign administrators for each organization. 

3. Configure policies for organizations to manage access to their sessions and mentors.

## Default Organization

After setting up the application, a **Default** organization is created. Users who are not part of any organization are added to **Default** and the system administrator acts as the organization administrator.

## Assigning Users to Organizations

Users who sign up using a shared link are assigned a mentee (default) role. The mentee's organization is detected based on the organizational domain in the email ID.

If the organization uploads email IDs to the platform, the users would receive email invites. The administrator can pre-register email IDs that belong to corporate as well as public domains. After signing up, such users are detected as organizational users in the application.

## Policy Architecture

From the back end, organizations can configure policies to:

* Provide registered users conditional access to mentors or sessions, irrespective of the organizations to which they belong.

* Provide their own mentees conditional access to mentors and sessions of other organizations.

Organizations can independently deny or allow access to mentors and sessions. If mentor access is denied, users cannot view the mentor profiles in the Mentor Directory. If session access is denied, users cannot view the session hosted by the mentors of an organization.

|Types of Policies|Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|All|An organization can set their policy as **All** to achieve the following:<ul><li>Allow other organizations' mentees to access their mentors or sessions.</li><li>Allow their mentees conditional access to other organization's mentors or sessions.</li></ul>|
|Current|An organization can set their policy as **Current** to achieve the following:<ul><li>Allow their mentees to access only their mentors and sessions.</li><li>Deny mentees of other organizations to access their sessions or mentors.</li></ul>|
|Associated|The **Associated** policy involves two or more organizations. Mentees can only access mentors or sessions of these associated organizations.|
