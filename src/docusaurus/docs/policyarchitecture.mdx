# Multi-Tenant Architecture

The <PartialExample mentored /> platform has a multi-tenant architecture, and adopters can:

1. Set up the application using the microservices.

2. Create multiple organizations and assign administrators for each organization.

## Default Organization

After setting up the application, a **Default** organization is created. Users who are not part of any organization are added to **Default** and the system administrator acts as the organization administrator.

    </ul>
    </Admonition>
</p>

## Assigning Users to Organizations

Users who sign up using a shared link are assigned a mentee (default) role. The mentee's organization is detected based on the organizational domain in the email ID.

If the organization uploads email IDs to the platform, the users would receive email invites. The administrator can pre-register email IDs that belong to corporate as well as public domains. After signing up, such users are detected as organizational users in the application.

    <p>After signing up, if the email ID is not registered by the organization or if it does not belong to the organizational domain, the user is added to the <b>Default</b> organization.</p>

## Policy Architecture

Organization administrators can use policies to manage access to mentees, mentors, and sessions across organizations.

    <td><p>If the policy is set to <b>Current</b>, only users belonging to the organization can access the mentors, mentees, or sessions. Similarly, the organization’s users cannot access mentees, mentors, or sessions of other organizations.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Associated</td>
    <td><p>The <b>Associated</b> policy provides users with access to mentors, mentees, or sessions across multiple organizations.</p><p>For example, if organizations A and B are linked with the <b>Associated</b> policy, only users belonging to these two organizations can access the mentors, mentees, or sessions of both organizations.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Default Rules

To manage access to sessions or mentors within an organization, organization administrators can set default rules to allow their users to access mentors or sessions only based on the information specified in their profile. 

For example, if the platform contains a session that requires mentees to have expertise in communication, the organization can set rules to allow only those mentees, who have specified communication as their area of expertise in their profile, to discover and enroll for the session.

Using default rules, organizations can improve user experience by curating sessions or mentor discovery as per the users' profile information. 

For example, if there are sessions hosted in multiple languages, organization administrators can set default rules to match users with sessions or mentors based on the language. If a user specifies Hindi as their preferred language on the profile, the application would list only the sessions conducted in Hindi or profiles of mentors who are proficient in Hindi.
