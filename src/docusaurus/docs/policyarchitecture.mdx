# Multi-Tenant Architecture

The <PartialExample mentored /> platform has a multi-tenant architecture, and adopters can set up the application using the microservices and create multiple organizations. Organizations can manage access to their sessions and mentors for mentees from other organizations.

The organization and its users are identified based on:

* The **domain name** in the email ID of registered users. 

    <p>  
        <Admonition type="note">
        <p>If the email ID does not belong to the organizational domain, the application assigns the user's organization as <b>Default</b>.</p>
        </Admonition>
    </p>

* Whether the users have signed up using an invite received from their organization.

    <p>  
        <Admonition type="note">
        <p>Users who sign up through a link received from their contacts are identified as mentees of <b>Default</b> organization.</p>
        </Admonition>
    </p>

* The organization that uploaded users to the application. See [Uploading Users to the Application](bulkupload) to learn more.

    <p>  
        <Admonition type="note">
        <p>In this case, all email IDs irrespective of whether they belong to the organization or not, are treated as organizational users.</p>
        </Admonition>
    </p>

## Policy Architecture

From the back end, organizations can configure policies to deny or allow:

* A user's access to mentors or sessions of their organization.

* Mentees from accessing mentors or sessions of other organizations.

Organizations can independently deny or allow access to mentors and sessions. If mentor access is denied, users cannot view the mentor profiles in the Mentor Directory. If session access is denied, users cannot view the session hosted by the mentors of an organization.

|Types of Policies|Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|All|An organization can set their policy as **All** to achieve the following:<ul><li>Allow other organizations' mentees to access their mentors or sessions.</li><li>Allow their mentees conditional access to other organization's mentors or sessions.</li></ul>|
|Current|An organization can set their policy as **Current** to achieve the following:<ul><li>Allow their mentees to access only their mentors and sessions.</li><li>Deny mentees of other organizations to access their sessions or mentors.</li></ul>|
|Associated|The **Associated** policy involves two or more organizations. Mentees can only access mentors or sessions of these associated organizations.|
