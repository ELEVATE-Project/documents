# Policy Architecture

From the back end, organizations can configure policies to deny or allow:

* A user's access to mentors or sessions of their organization.

* Mentees from accessing mentors or sessions of other organizations.

Organizations can independently deny or allow access to mentors and sessions. If mentor access is denied, users cannot view the mentor profiles in the Mentor Directory. If session access is denied, users cannot view the session hosted by the mentors of an organization.

Before providing policy-based access, the users and organization are identified based on:

* The **domain name** in the email ID of registered users. 

    <p>  
        <Admonition type="note">
        <p>If the email ID does not belong to the organizational domain, the application assigns the user's organization as <b>Default</b>.</p>
        </Admonition>
    </p>

* The organization that uploaded users to the application. 

    <p>  
        <Admonition type="note">
        <p>In this case, all email IDs irrespective of whether they belong to the organization or not, are treated as organizational users.</p>
        </Admonition>
    </p>
