## Policy Architecture

Organization administrators can use policies to manage access to mentees, mentors, and sessions across organizations.

    <td>Associated</td>
    <td><p>The <b>Associated</b> policy provides users with access to mentors, mentees, or sessions across multiple organizations.</p><p>For example, if organizations A and B are linked with the <b>Associated</b> policy, only users belonging to these two organizations can access the mentors, mentees, or sessions of both organizations.</p></td>

## Rules for Mentor and Session Discovery

Organization administrators can set rules to allow users within the organization to connect and seek mentorship opportunities.

Examples:

* If the platform contains sessions on communication, users seeking improvements in this domain can connect and seek guidance from each other. 

* If there are sessions hosted in multiple languages, users with similar language preferences can connect and seek guidance from each other.
