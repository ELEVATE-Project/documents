# Multi-Tenant Architecture

The <PartialExample mentored /> platform has a multi-tenant architecture, and adopters can:

1. Set up the application using the microservices.

2. Create multiple organizations and assign administrators for each organization.

## Default Organization

After setting up the application, a **Default** organization is created. Users who are not part of any organization are added to **Default** and the system administrator acts as the organization administrator.

<p>  
    <Admonition type="info">
    <p>See the following topics to learn more about the Organization Administrator role:</p>

    </ul>
    </Admonition>
</p>

## Assigning Users to Organizations

Users who sign up using a shared link are assigned a mentee (default) role. The mentee's organization is detected based on the organizational domain in the email ID.

If the organization uploads email IDs to the platform, the users would receive email invites. The administrator can pre-register email IDs that belong to corporate as well as public domains. After signing up, such users are detected as organizational users in the application.

    <Admonition type="note">
    <p>After signing up, if the email ID is not registered by the organization or if it does not belong to the organizational domain, the user is added to the <b>Default</b> organization.</p>

## Policy Architecture

Organization administrators can use policies to manage access to mentees, mentors, and sessions across organizations.

    <td><p>If the policy is set to <b>Current</b>, only users belonging to the organization can access the mentors, mentees, or sessions. Similarly, the organization’s users cannot access mentees, mentors, or sessions of other organizations.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Associated</td>
    <td><p>The <b>Associated</b> policy provides users with access to mentors, mentees, or sessions across multiple organizations.</p><p>For example, if organizations A and B are linked with the <b>Associated</b> policy, only users belonging to these two organizations can access the mentors, mentees, or sessions of both organizations.</p></td>
  </tr>

## Rules for Mentor and Session Discovery

Organization administrators can set rules to allow users within the organization to connect and seek mentorship opportunities.

Examples:

* If the platform contains sessions on communication, users seeking improvements in this domain can connect and seek guidance from each other. 

* If there are sessions hosted in multiple languages, users with similar language preferences can connect and seek guidance from each other.
