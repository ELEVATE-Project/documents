# Hosting and Customizing Mentor

The <PartialExample mentored /> capability is enabled by the <PartialExample mentored /> microservice which can be set up in any cloud environment or in an on-premise setup. 

In addition, system administrators can also set up a reference implementation (PWA) and customize the look and feel based on the needs. See [Customize the PWA](settingup-pwa) to learn more.

Other services such as User, Notification, Scheduler, and BigBlueButton are optional. The <PartialExample mentored /> service can work with one or more existing implementations of the same.

To host a customized instance of <PartialExample mentored />:

1. Set up PostgreSQL.
2. [Install Node.jsÂ® on Ubuntu 20.04](https://serverspace.io) (Search for *Install Node.js on Ubuntu 20.04* in the Tutorials section.).
3. Set up <PartialExample mentored /> service.
4. [Customize the PWA](settingup-pwa).

Optionally, to set up supporting services do as follows:

* [Install Apache Kafka on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community) (Search for *Install Apache Kafka on Ubuntu 20.04* in the **Community** search box.).
