An improvement project is a construct that help Leaders (such as HT,HM, CRPs, DEOs, and DIET officials) and teachers to do the following actions:

* Define and track a set of tasks to achieve specific objectives.

* Take up projects for a particular time to improve any process, program, or activity.

* Earn certificates by successfully completing the projects.

Targeted initiatives can address specific challenges and drive improvements across various levels of the education system. Here are some examples:

* A school leader might conduct a project on Parent-Teacher Meetings to involve parents more actively in their child's learning.

* Teachers could take on projects using Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) to improve student engagement and outcomes in the classroom.

* Cluster or district officials might focus on school enrollment projects to bring out-of-school children into schools within their jurisdiction.

* Additionally, teachers could work on projects involving innovative pedagogy to share best practices among their peers.

## Project Building Block

The <ProductName /> building block empowers users to **access, discover, and create** improvement projects that can be customized to the specific needs of the users. With this capability, users can take on assigned projects, find projects that align with their objectives, or create their own projects that can benefit others.
