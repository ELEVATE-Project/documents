# Hosting and Customizing Projects

The <ProductName /> capability is enabled by the <ProductName /> microservice which can be set up in any cloud environment or in an on-premise setup.

In addition, system administrators can also set up a reference implementation (Progressive Web App or PWA) and customize the look and feel based on the needs. See [Customize the PWA](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/observation-survey-projects-pwa/blob/main/README.md) to learn more.

Other services such as User, Notification, Scheduler, and Entity Management are optional. The <ProductName />  service can work with one or more existing implementations of the same.

To host a customized instance of <ProductName />:

1. [Install Node.js® on Ubuntu 20.04](https://serverspace.io) (Search for *Install Node.js on Ubuntu 20.04* in the Tutorials section.).
2. [Set up <ProductName /> service](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/blob/main/README.md).
3. [Set up Gotenberg Service](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-service/blob/main/README.md).
4. [Set up Interface service](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/interface-service/blob/main/README.md).
5. Do one of the following:
    * Set up the [PWA](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/observation-survey-projects-pwa/blob/main/README.md).
    * To set up the component using users can take up and manage projects, see [Project Player](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/project-player/blob/master/README.md).
