# Hosting and Customizing Projects

The <ProductName /> capability is enabled by the <ProductName /> microservice which can be set up in any cloud environment or in an on-premise setup.

In addition, system administrators can also set up a reference implementation (Progressive Web App or PWA) and customize the look and feel based on the needs. See [Customize the PWA](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/observation-survey-projects-pwa/blob/main/README.md) to learn more.

Other services such as User, Notification, Scheduler, and Entity Management are optional. The <ProductName />  service can work with one or more existing implementations of the same.

**To host a customized instance of <ProductName />, refer to the README section of the following link:**
