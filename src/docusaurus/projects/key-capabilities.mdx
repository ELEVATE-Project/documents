# Key Capabilities of Projects

Project or Micro-improvement projects (MIPs) are action-oriented initiatives with specific objectives that lead to improvement. They enable users to define and track tasks, ensuring progress towards goals. 

Throughout the improvement journey, users can upload evidence such as images, videos, or documents to support their initiatives. This helps in tracking progress, showcasing achievements, and sharing best practices with relevant stakeholders, promoting collaboration, feedback, and learning from each other's experiences. This fosters a culture of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing within the education ecosystem. 

Users can also receive certificates after submission to celebrate the successful completion of the projects.
