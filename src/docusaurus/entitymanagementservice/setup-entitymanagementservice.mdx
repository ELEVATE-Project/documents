# Setting up Entity Management Service

Using the Entity Management service, system administrators can create and manage entities.

For example, to assign improvement projects to institutions within a particular district, system administrators can define a list of districts (or entities).

See [Setting up Entity Management Service](https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/entity-management/blob/main/README.md).
