# About Surveys Application

Surveys are powerful tools to gain insights and assess the gaps to make learning and development context-aware to deliver meaningful impact. 

The salient features of <ProductName /> are as follows:

* Formulate questions in various formats such as single-select or multi-select questions, date-entry questions, slider questions, and text-only or number-only question.
* Record multiple instances of the same questions and capture data for each individual entry.
* Add dependent questions to a single-select question. These questions determine the next question posed to users based on their response to the main question. 
* Provide prompts such as Tips or Hints to help users to add their responses.
* Track the survey's or observation's progress using the Progress bar.
* Navigate to different pages of the questionnaire using the Question Map.
* Add remarks or additional information to the responses. 
* Add evidence to support your response.

## Measuring impact

Today, our <ProductName /> capability has enabled over 6,00,000 school leaders and counting in Punjab. Observing things granularly and getting a sense of the current state allowed [ShikshaLokam](https://shikshalokam.org/) and [Punjab Education Collective's (PEC)](https://www.sanjhisikhiya.org/punjab-education-collective) education leaders to co-create change in the desired direction. The capability is an open-source solution for anyone to 'Observe before they Act'.
