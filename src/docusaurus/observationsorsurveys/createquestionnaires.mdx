# Creating Questionnaires

Users with creator role can create customized questionnaires for conducting surveys. These surveys can be accessed by users for a defined time period, allowing them to collect and record information, including evidence, related to specific areas of improvement. 

For instance, teachers may take a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching and learning methodologies being implemented at their institution.
