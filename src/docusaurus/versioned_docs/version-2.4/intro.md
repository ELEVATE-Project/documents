## Overview

This microsite contains detailed documentation that helps organisations understand the <PartialExample mentored /> Building Block. 

Till recently, mentees needed to travel to different locations to attend sessions to upskill and enhance their expertise. Face-to-face learning was the only way that was considered effective. 

The COVID-19 pandemic changed all or this. Mobile and web adoption accelerated as organizations started hosting online learning sessions.

<PartialExample mentored /> is a technology platform using which mentees can discover trusted mentors in their chosen domain and get mentored through online, instructor-led sessions. Mentees can access training and learning, without needing to travel to attend sessions.

## Introduction

With the ubiquity of the Internet, learners have access to online learning and training resources from across the globe. The pandemic gave an impetus, and today, India has over 13.6 million learners online (WEF report 2022) &mdash; the second largest in the world. Yet, people need to be more skilled to get employed. 

This gap needs to be bridged through a network of mentors and experts available in our ecosystem. Expertise is available in each domain, but we need to build pathways to connect mentees with mentors to seek guidance. 

<Admonition type="info">
<p>The government has undertaken many initiatives to drive learners online, like the National Digital Educational Architecture (NDEAR), PM eVIDYA Program, Samagra Shiksha Scheme, ‘ShaGun’, DIKSHA, SWAYAM, Shiksha Van, E-Pathshala, National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER), and to upskill them with emerging technologies such as National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) and FutureSkills (NASSCOM).</p>
<p>The National Education Policy (2020) has identified the need to create a marketplace where mentors and mentees discover one another and engage for guidance and professional development. The National Mentoring Mission (NMM) envisions a large, decentralized, tech-assisted mentoring structure at different levels of the education and upskilling ecosystem. The NMM encourages the use of digital technologies to make the initiative auto-scalable, diverse, inclusive, and context-aware.</p>

## Mentor Building Block

<PartialExample mentored /> building block facilitates the development of a mentoring network by enabling online interactions between mentees and mentors in the ecosystem. Using the network, mentees can <b>search for and discover experts</b> and seek guidance for professional development. <div class="wrapText"><img src={Intro} /></div>

The capability endeavours to build a marketplace for mentors and mentees where mentees discover (trusted) mentors, establish a connection, and schedule <PartialExample mentored /> sessions. Thereafter, the mentor and mentee rate the session and share their feedback. 

Currently, the capability enables only mentor-driven interactions (group mentoring). However, sessions conducted by mentees are part of the roadmap.

The long-term vision of the <PartialExample mentored /> building block is to create a country-wide pool of academic experts in different subjects and areas of knowledge to support the workforce. The mentor building block has the potential to address the **skill gap** in all sectors of the economy. It encourages a cross-section of ideas and information sharing and opens avenues for cross-learning and interdisciplinary growth. 

It can be leveraged to upskill and build capability in academia, government organisations, and corporations. Over time, such a rich and reliable pool of mentors can become a vital resource for new entrants in the job market and the existing workforce to stay abreast of future skills. Thus, continuously upskilling the society's **human capital base** and keeping them job-fit.

<PartialExample mentored /> includes a microservice, reference portal or web application, and Data analytics. The service is developed in compliance with NDEAR principles. The services are generic, configurable, scalable, and enable interoperability.
