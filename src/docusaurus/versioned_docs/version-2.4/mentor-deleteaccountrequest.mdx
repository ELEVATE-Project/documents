# Creating a Request to Delete the Account

After creating a request to delete your account, the following actions take place:

* Your enrollment to sessions gets cancelled.
* Your profile is removed from the Mentor Directory.
* The sessions that you have created are deleted.
* You cannot enroll for a new session.
* Once you are logged out, you cannot access your account.

However, before you loose the access to your account, you can still view the following pages on MentorED:

* Activity insights on the Dashboard.
* Profiles of other mentors in the Mentor Directory.
* Upcoming sessions on the Home page.
* Your profile details.

**To create a request to delete your account, do as follows:**
