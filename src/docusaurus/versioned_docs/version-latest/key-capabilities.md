# Key Capabilities of Mentor

<PartialExample mentored /> building block enables online interactions between mentors and mentees by connecting the domain experts and making them accessible to mentees. The capability leverages video conferencing tools and a built-in chat feature for mentees to connect and schedule mentoring sessions. The recommendation engine maps mentees with mentors or experts based on criteria such as skills, organizations, domains, language, and locations. This enables access to a variety of learning experiences.

Multiple formats of mentoring interaction are possible. While one-on-one mentoring enables personalised development, group mentoring allows for upskilling and capacity-building opportunities. It also opens doors for interdisciplinary skill development. 

## Types of Mentoring

|Types of Mentoring| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Group Mentoring|A group of mentees is assigned to a mentor in a session. The mentor creates sessions and publish them on the platform. The session follows a format similar to a webinar. However, it encourages a long-term relationship between mentors and mentees.|
|One-on-one Mentoring|A mentor works with a mentee. To curate personalised professional development paths, mentee can either search for a mentor or get assigned to a mentor.|
|Flash Mentoring|A mentor provides a just-in-time support to a mentee. The session follows a one-time (short-term) format that allows mentees to seek immediate support and guidance.|

One of the most important things to recognise about **mentoring as an approach to learning** is that it is incredibly diverse and can have a formal or informal setup.
