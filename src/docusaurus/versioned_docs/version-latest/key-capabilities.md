# Key Capabilities of Mentor

<PartialExample mentored /> building block enables online interactions between mentors and mentees by connecting the domain experts and making them accessible to mentees. The capability leverages video conferencing tools for mentees to connect and join mentoring sessions. The recommendation engine maps mentees with mentors or experts based on criteria such as skills, organizations, domains, language, and locations. This enables access to a variety of learning experiences.

>

<PartialExample mentored /> currently supports group mentoring interactions where a group of mentees get associated to a mentor in a session. The mentor creates sessions and publish them on the platform. The session follows a format similar to a webinar. However, it encourages a long-term relationship between mentors and mentees.

Through group mentoring, mentees can access upskilling and capacity-building opportunities. It also opens doors for interdisciplinary skill development.

In addition to the <PartialExample mentored /> microservice, the building block provides additional microservices such as:

* <a href="settingup-userservice">User Service</a>
* <a href="settingup-notificationsservice">Notifications Service</a>
* <a href="settingup-schedulerservice">Scheduler Service</a> 

The <PartialExample mentored />  building block can be deployed as a stand-alone capability or used in conjunction with other learning and development management solutions. 

An instance of <PartialExample mentored /> (sandbox solution) is created to demonstrate some of the capabilities. This document provides the <a href="using-the-application">user guide</a> for the reference solution (<PartialExample mentored />).
