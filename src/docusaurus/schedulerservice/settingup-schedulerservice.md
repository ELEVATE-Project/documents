# Setting up the Scheduler Service

System administrators can set up the Scheduler service to execute tasks at a specific time or interval or at repeated intervals.

For example, using the Scheduler service, the <PartialExample mentored /> service can be configured to send notifications to mentors and mentees before a session starts.
