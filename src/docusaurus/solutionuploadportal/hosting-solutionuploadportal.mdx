# Hosting and Customizing Solution Upload Portal

The Solution Upload Portal simplifies the creation, validation and publishing of various solution types.
This can be set up in any cloud environment. 


The application consists of two components:


1. Backend: A Python-based service that handles data and storage.
2. Frontend: An Angular-based web application for user interactions.

To host and customize the Solution Upload Portal:

1. Install Python on Ubuntu or Windows.
   * <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu">Install Python</a> and configure it for the backend service.

2. Set up MongoDB.
   * <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/">Install MongoDB</a> and configure it for the backend service.

3. Set up the backend service.
   * <a href="https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/solution-upload-portal-service"> Backend Repository</a>

   * Install the necessary Python dependencies using either <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html">Conda</a> or a Python virtual environment.

4. Set up the frontend service.
   * <a href="https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/solution-upload-portal"> Frontend Repository</a>

      Install Angular CLI:  
      This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli"> Angular CLI </a> version 13.3.9.   
      Build and serve the frontend application.  
      
## Customizing the Portal

   You can customize the look and feel of the Solution Upload Portal based on the requirements. 

1. To customize the backend:

    * Update <a href="https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/solution-upload-portal-service/blob/main/README.md"> .env</a> variables in the backend service to match the server configurations.
    * Add or modify the API endpoints as per the requirements.

2. To customize the frontend:

   * Use Angular's CLI to generate or modify components:   

      **```bash**     
      **ng generate component component-name**   
      **```**   
   * Update styles and themes in the <a href="https://github.com/ELEVATE-Project/solution-upload-portal/blob/main/src/styles.scss"> src/styles.scss </a> file.

   * Deploy the customized code to your preferred hosting service.

3. To integrate it with other systems:

   * Embed the frontend application into an existing portal.
   * Use API integrations to connect the backend service with other systems.
