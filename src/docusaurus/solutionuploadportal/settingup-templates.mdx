# Overview

The Solution Upload Portal is a unified portal that simplifies the creation, validation, and publishing of various Solution types, including Observations, Surveys, Projects, and Programs. Users can access pre-designed templates for each solution type and fill them out, ensuring the data follows the specified format and guidelines. Once validated for accuracy, these Solutions are created and published, making them available for end users.

In addition to creating and publishing new Solutions, the portal also allows users to manage and review their past contributions, providing a clear and organized view of their work. This seamless process simplifies both the creation and tracking of Solutions, making it easier to manage and build upon them over time.
